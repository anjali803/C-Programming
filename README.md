# C-Programming
This repository of basic C programming programs is designed to help beginners get started with C programming. It's a great resource for learning the fundamentals of the language and building your confidence as you progress.

If you're just starting out with programming, C is a great language to learn. It's a versatile and widely-used language that can be used to create everything from simple console applications to complex operating systems.

However, like any new skill, learning C programming can be challenging. It can be difficult to know where to start, and even basic concepts can be confusing if you're not used to thinking in terms of code. That's why I created this repository of basic C programming programs that are designed specifically for beginners.

The programs in this repository cover a range of fundamental topics, including input/output, conditional statements, loops, arrays, and functions. Each program is designed to be simple and easy to understand, even if you've never coded before. They're also well-documented, with comments that explain what each line of code does and why it's important.

Some of the programs you'll find in this repository include:

A program that calculates the area of a rectangle, given its length and width
A program that takes user input and prints out whether a number is even or odd
A program that prints out the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
A program that sorts an array of numbers in ascending order
These programs are just a small sample of what you'll find in the repository. They're intended to give you a taste of what C programming is like and help you build your confidence as you learn.

Whether you're a complete beginner or just looking to brush up on your C programming skills, this repository is a great resource to have. You can fork it, modify the programs, and use them as a starting point for your own projects. You can also learn from the code and use it as a reference as you continue your C programming journey.
